# AI Training System - Current Status

## ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS - Bot is Taking Actions!

### What's Working NOW:
1. ‚úÖ **Node.js 20** - Downgraded from v25 to v20 LTS (fixed TensorFlow compatibility)
2. ‚úÖ **Coordinate conversion** - Properly converts hex {q,r,direction} to Cartesian {x,y}
3. ‚úÖ **State encoding** - Fixed to match server's actual property names (`armySize` not `knightsPlayed`)
4. ‚úÖ **Action masking** - Correctly identifies valid settlement placements (38 actions)
5. ‚úÖ **Neural network** - Removed batch normalization (was causing NaN with untrained weights)
6. ‚úÖ **Softmax computation** - Fixed NaN issues by using manual softmax with proper masking
7. ‚úÖ **Bot places settlement** - Bot successfully selects and executes `BUILD_SETTLEMENT_SETUP`!

### Current Status:
**Bot is now successfully placing the first settlement!** The output shows:
```
[SampleAction] Valid actions: 38, Prob sum: 1.0000, Has NaN: false
[SampleAction] Sampled action index: 7, Is valid: true, Prob: 0.027444
[Bot0] Executing action: BUILD_SETTLEMENT_SETUP
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue:

**Game halts after first settlement** - The bot places a settlement but doesn't build a road next.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Server might be rejecting the settlement** - Coordinate conversion could still be slightly off
2. **Server not sending gameUpdate** - Bot might not receive state update after placement
3. **Action mask not updating** - Bot might not see road building as valid after settlement placement

### How to Debug:
1. Check server logs to see if settlement is accepted
2. Add more logging to see if `gameUpdate` event is received after settlement placement
3. Verify that after placing settlement, the bot's state shows `settlements.length === 1`
4. Check if road actions are being properly masked when bot has 1 settlement

## üîÑ All Issues Fixed So Far:

### Issue 1: TensorFlow Library ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: `TypeError: (0 , util_1.isNullOrUndefined) is not a function`
**Root Cause**: Node.js 25 incompatibility with TensorFlow.js 4.22.0
**Solution**: Downgraded to Node.js 20 LTS using Homebrew

### Issue 2: Batch Normalization NaN ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Neural network producing NaN values
**Root Cause**: Batch normalization layers with untrained weights cause NaN in inference mode
**Solution**: Removed batch normalization from network architecture (can add back during training)

### Issue 3: Property Name Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: State encoder producing NaN in player stats
**Root Cause**: AI expected `player.knightsPlayed` but server uses `player.armySize`
**Solution**: Updated AI types.ts to match server's Player interface:
- Changed `knightsPlayed` to `armySize`
- Added `largestArmy`, `longestRoad`, `longestRoadLength` properties

### Issue 4: Wrong Turn Phase ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: No valid actions in setup phase
**Root Cause**: Action mask checked for `turnPhase === 'build'` but server uses `'place'` in setup
**Solution**: Changed condition to `turnPhase === 'place'` in setup phase

### Issue 5: Coordinate System ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: AI uses hex {q,r,direction} but server uses Cartesian {x,y}
**Solution**: Implemented proper conversion in 3 places:
- `aiPlayer.ts`: Convert AI actions to server format when sending
- `stateEncoder.ts`: Convert for state encoding comparisons
- `actionEncoder.ts`: Convert for action masking

### Issue 6: Incorrect Vertex/Edge Counts ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Expected 54 vertices and 72 edges, but actual board has 38 and 57
**Solution**: Updated constants and recalculated action space (255 actions instead of 333)

## üìä System Architecture:

### Dimensions:
- **State size**: 865 features
- **Action size**: 255 discrete actions
- **Hexes**: 19
- **Vertices**: 38 (q‚àà[-2,2], r‚àà[-2,2] where |q+r|‚â§2, √ó 2 directions)
- **Edges**: 57 (same hex range √ó 3 directions)

### Coordinate Conversion Formula:
```typescript
const size = 1;
const hexX = size * (3/2 * q);
const hexY = size * (Math.sqrt(3)/2 * q + Math.sqrt(3) * r);

// For vertices:
const vertexIndex = direction === 'N' ? 1 : 4;  // N=top-left, S=bottom-left
const angle = Math.PI / 3 * vertexIndex;
const x = hexX + size * Math.cos(angle);
const y = hexY + size * Math.sin(angle);

// For edges:
const [v1Index, v2Index] = {
  'NE': [0, 1],  // right ‚Üí top-left
  'E': [5, 0],   // bottom-right ‚Üí right
  'SE': [4, 5]   // bottom-left ‚Üí bottom-right
}[direction];
```

## üéØ Next Steps:

### Immediate:
1. **Add detailed logging** to see:
   - If server accepts or rejects settlement placement
   - If `gameUpdate` event is received after action
   - What the bot's state looks like after settlement placement
   - If road actions are properly masked

2. **Debug settlement placement**:
   - Verify coordinates are correct by checking server logs
   - Ensure server broadcasts `gameUpdate` after successful placement
   - Check that bot's state updates to show `settlements.length === 1`

3. **Fix road building flow**:
   - Ensure action mask includes road actions after settlement placed
   - Verify road coordinate conversion is correct
   - Test full setup phase (settlement ‚Üí road for all 4 players)

### Short-term:
- Complete first full game with all 4 bots
- Implement proper game loop (setup ‚Üí main game ‚Üí finish)
- Handle all action types (roll, build, trade, dev cards)

### Medium-term:
- Start self-play training loop
- Collect experiences from games
- Train neural network with PPO algorithm
- Monitor training metrics and losses

## üí° Key Learnings:

1. **Type mismatches are dangerous** - Server and AI must use exact same property names
2. **Batch normalization needs training** - Can't use with random weights in inference mode
3. **Coordinate systems need careful alignment** - Even small differences cause failures
4. **Action masking is critical** - Without proper masking, invalid actions break the game
5. **Node.js version matters** - Bleeding edge versions have compatibility issues

## üìù Summary:

**HUGE PROGRESS!** We've fixed 6 major issues and the bot is now:
- ‚úÖ Connecting to server
- ‚úÖ Creating and joining games
- ‚úÖ Encoding state without NaN
- ‚úÖ Generating valid action probabilities
- ‚úÖ **Selecting and placing settlements!**

**Next challenge**: Get the bot to build a road after the settlement, completing the setup phase turn cycle.

**Estimated time to full operation**: 1-2 hours (just need to debug why game halts after settlement)

Once this is fixed, bots will play complete games and training can begin! üöÄ
