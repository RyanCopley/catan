# Catan AI Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete neural network-based AI training system for Settlers of Catan using:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Self-Play Training**: 4 bots play against each other
- **WebSocket Integration**: Bots connect to existing server (no server modifications needed)

## Architecture Overview

```
Training Loop:
  1. Self-Play Phase → 4 AI bots play complete games
  2. Data Collection → Store (state, action, reward) experiences
  3. Training Phase → Update neural network with PPO
  4. Repeat → Continuous improvement

Components:
  - State Encoder: Game state → 1084-dim feature vector
  - Action Encoder: 333 discrete actions with masking
  - Neural Network: Actor-Critic with policy + value heads
  - AI Bot: WebSocket client that plays autonomously
  - PPO Trainer: Gradient-based policy optimization
  - Orchestrator: Manages self-play games
```

## Key Features

### 1. State Representation (1084 features)
- **Board**: Hex terrain types, number tokens, robber position
- **Buildings**: Settlements/cities/roads per player
- **Resources**: Player's hand (visible), opponents' totals
- **Development Cards**: Card counts per player
- **Game State**: Phase, current player, special achievements

### 2. Action Space (333 actions)
- **Setup**: Place settlements (54) + roads (72)
- **Main Game**:
  - Roll dice (1)
  - Build: settlements (54), cities (54), roads (72)
  - Buy development card (1)
  - Play knight (1)
  - Move robber (19)
  - Steal from player (4)
  - End turn (1)

### 3. Neural Network
- **Input**: 1084-dim state vector
- **Architecture**:
  - Shared layers: 3x Dense(256) + BatchNorm + ReLU
  - Policy head: Dense(128) → Dense(333) [action logits]
  - Value head: Dense(128) → Dense(1) [win probability]
- **Total Parameters**: ~195K trainable

### 4. Training Algorithm (PPO)
- **Advantage Estimation**: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- **Policy Update**: Clipped surrogate objective (ε=0.2)
- **Value Update**: Mean squared error
- **Exploration**: Entropy bonus
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer (lr=3e-4)

### 5. Reward Shaping
- **Terminal**: Win (+1.0), Loss (-1.0)
- **Incremental**:
  - Victory point: +0.1
  - Settlement built: +0.05
  - City built: +0.08
  - Longest road gained: +0.15
  - Largest army gained: +0.15
  - Resource gained: +0.001
  - Invalid action: -0.01

## How to Use

### Basic Training
```bash
cd ai
npm install
npm run build
npm run train
```

### Configuration
Edit `ai/config/training.config.ts`:
```typescript
selfPlay: {
  gamesPerCycle: 10,  // Games before training
}
training: {
  learningRate: 3e-4,
  batchSize: 64,
}
```

### Monitor Progress
- Logs: `ai/logs/training_*.json`
- Checkpoints: `ai/checkpoints/model_cycle_N/`
- Console output shows losses and win rates

### Test Trained Model
```typescript
const network = new CatanNet();
await network.load('./ai/checkpoints/model_cycle_100');
const bot = new AIPlayer(network, 'TestBot');
await bot.createGame();
```

## Technical Highlights

### Action Masking
- Network outputs logits for all 333 actions
- Invalid actions set to -∞ before softmax
- Ensures bot only selects legal moves
- Implemented in `actionEncoder.ts`

### Experience Replay
- On-policy: Buffer cleared after each training
- GAE (λ=0.95) for advantage estimation
- Normalizes advantages for stable training

### Self-Play Workflow
1. Orchestrator spawns 4 AI bots
2. Bot 1 creates game via Socket.IO
3. Bots 2-4 join using game ID
4. Bot 1 starts game
5. All bots play autonomously
6. Experiences collected from all 4 perspectives
7. Bots disconnect after game ends

### No Server Modifications
- Bots are pure clients
- Connect via standard Socket.IO
- Same events as human players
- Server doesn't know they're AI

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations (MVP)
- No player-to-player trading
- No bank trading (4:1, 3:1, 2:1)
- Limited development cards (only Knight implemented)
- Simplified placement validation (relies on server)
- No opponent modeling

### Potential Improvements
1. **State Encoding**:
   - CNN for spatial board features
   - Attention mechanisms for player interactions
   - Better resource estimation for opponents

2. **Action Space**:
   - Add trading actions
   - Full dev card support (Road Building, YoP, Monopoly)
   - Hierarchical actions (select action type → select parameters)

3. **Training**:
   - Curriculum learning (start with simpler scenarios)
   - Population-based training (multiple networks)
   - Opponent diversity (mix of skill levels)
   - Transfer learning from human games

4. **Architecture**:
   - Larger networks (512+ hidden units)
   - Deeper networks (5+ layers)
   - Recurrent layers for game history
   - Graph neural networks for board structure

5. **Performance**:
   - GPU acceleration
   - Parallel self-play across machines
   - Distributed training
   - Model compression for inference

## Expected Results

### Training Timeline (Rough Estimates)
- **Cycles 1-10**: Random play, learning basic actions
- **Cycles 10-50**: Learns to build preferentially
- **Cycles 50-200**: Basic strategies emerge
- **Cycles 200-500**: Positional understanding
- **Cycles 500+**: Advanced strategies

### Compute Requirements
- **Per Game**: ~2-5 minutes (4 bots, full game)
- **Per Cycle** (10 games): ~20-50 minutes
- **100 Cycles**: ~1-3 days on CPU
- **GPU**: 5-10x faster

### Performance Metrics
- Win rate (should approach 25% for balanced learning)
- Average victory points per game
- Average game length
- Policy entropy (exploration measure)
- Value prediction accuracy

## Dependencies

```json
{
  "@tensorflow/tfjs-node": "^4.11.0",

## Testing

Basic component test:

npm run build
node dist/test.js
```

Verifies:
- State encoder dimensions
- Action space size
- Network construction
- Model save/load
